TEXT COLOR AND FONT
Fonts and colors were not showing until I did the following...


1) Run the following command in the terminal:
npx tailwindcss init

This creates a file tailwind.config.js in the root directory i.e. same directory as package.json

2) Update the file content as follows:

module.exports = {
  content: [
    './public/**/*.{html,js}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

3) Run the following command in the terminal:
npm run build-css

4) Run the following command in the terminal:
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./public/styles.css --watch

Further reference: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation





If anyone finds they have to save the file twice to see changes, it'd be because the Live-Server picks up the HTML changes before tailwind has finished building the CSS file and doesn't register the change

Instead of > live-server public
Try > live-server public --no-css-inject

to implement uppercase just write uppercase 
text color weight eg text-red-700

MARGIN PADDING AND BORDERS 
make sure to run npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./public/styles.css --watch

TAILWIND CONFIG CUSTOMIZE

here we want to create our own color, font etc that is not available on default tailwind

run 
npx tailwindcss init --full
it creates a new file called  tailwind.config.js
then rename it to maybe tailwinddefault.config.js 
then create a new config ie npx tailwindcss init

add what you want in extends. Ie theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: "#FF6363",
        secondary: {
          100: "#E2E2D5",
          200: '#888883',
        }
      }
    },
  },
  plugins: [],

  remeber to add './public/**/*.{html,js}', in between content  //on tailwind.config.js, not the 
  other one we renamed

  to use it in index => class="text-primary" bg-secondary-100      .....etc bg is background








  CUSTOM FONTS 

  go to custom fonts website eg https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito, select what you want 
  in this case our font is nunito 
  copy ALL inside style ie. @import url('http........
  paste it on src=> styles file, at the top

  extend it like how we did previously above i.e 
    fontFamily: {
        body: ['Nunito']   //that body 'name' is also custom we can call it whatever we want and 'Nunito' has to be named that way
      }

to use it on index.html, class = 'font-body'

USING FLEX BOX

We use justify eg, class = 'justify-center, flex justify-end to position an item
add margin between them => ml-2

CARDS
 Here the cards are image, 5 bean stew, recipe by Mario

<div class="bg-white rounded-md overflow-hidden">
/* overflow-hidden to hide anything that goes over the boundaries of the card, eg image might not get rounded
at some corners because it goes beyond the card */

//to push"recipe by mario" down, use class="block"
//add margin m-4 to separate the 2 sentences, but should be inside the words div to prevent image also affected

//to make image size similar to card size, class="w-full h-32 sm:-48"
//h-32 means default height of 32
//sm means smaller screens
//but now we have distorted the image, we can correct that by object-cover, the image will onlyshow inside the card

BADGES
//Add a 25 mins badge

<div class="bg-secondary-100  text-secondary-200 text-xs uppercase font-bold rounded-full p-2 absolute top-0 ml-2 mt-2">
 <span>25 mins</span>


/*to position it from card, make card class relative, then mane badge div class absolute and add top-0 ml-2 mt-2 
 to make it move to the top left ml means margin left*/
// you have to add absolute for top-0 ml-2 mt-2 to work



@apply Directive

//if we want to re-use css code like in card, we use @apply
// go to src styles and save the css there Instead//give a class to the card div and delete the css code
//then on styles.css paste the css code there i.e 
.card{
    @apply bg-white rounded-md overflow-hidden drop-shadow-md relative
}


GRID 

give the cards container a class of grid then add the number of columns grid-cols-3
// add the grid gap, to have gaps btn thee grids gap-10
//to make it only apply to large screen add lg before, i.e lg:grid-cols-3 gap-10


//add a grid to the whole page i.e have navbar on left and content on right, but navbar is small 
so we'll have three grids and let it occupy one.

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-3"> <!-- content wrapper -->
        <div class="md:col-span-1"> // make nav occupy only one grid


 <main class="px-16 py-6 bg-gray-100 md:col-span-2"> // make the contents occupy the other 2


 BUTTONS

 give btn class to re-use it 
 .btn{
    @apply rounded-full py-2 px-3 uppercase text-xs font-bold cursor-pointer tracking-wider;
}

then style ONLY the ones on the top, in this case we will style it in the html
<a href="#" class=" btn text-primary border-primary md:border-2">Log in</a>
<a href="#" class="btn text-primary ml-2 border-primary md:border-2">Sign up</a>
//md for medium sized screen buttons border will only apply to mediumabd above screens


ICONS
we use third party to get the icons like  https://heroicons.com/, https://heroicons.dev/
click on an icon to copy code, 
paste it where you want it to be placed,

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" strokeWidth={1.5} stroke="currentColor" className="w-6 h-6">
  <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" d="M12 6v6h4.5m4.5 0a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z" />
</svg>

 give it a class to resize and position it
   <svg class="w-4 h-4 inline-block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" strokeWidth={1.5} stroke="currentColor" className="w-6 h-6">
  <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" d="M12 6v6h4.5m4.5 0a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z" />
 </svg>
 //inline block to make it sit in like with the words




 HOVER EFFECTS
 use hover:   then the effect you want
 hover:bg-red hover:text-white, this turns text intomwhite and button into red
 eg <a href="#" class=" btn text-red border-primary md:border-2 hover:bg-primary hover:text-white">Log in</a>
